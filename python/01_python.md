# Python 

## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** designed to be easy to read and write.

What makes Python different from many other languages is that it focuses heavily on **readability**. Python code often looks close to plain English, which makes it easier to understand what the program is doing.

Python is used for:

* scripting and automation
* backend development
* data engineering and data science
* machine learning
* building tools and utilities

## Why Python is easy to work with

Some reasons Python is considered beginner-friendly and powerful at the same time:

* No need to declare variable types explicitly
* Simple and clean syntax
* Large standard library
* Strong community support

This allows developers to focus more on **problem solving** rather than language complexity.

## How Python code is executed (high-level)

When a Python program is run:

1. The Python interpreter reads the code line by line
2. The code is converted into bytecode
3. The bytecode is executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM)

Because Python is interpreted, code is executed at runtime rather than being compiled into a standalone binary beforehand.

## Interpreted vs Compiled (brief understanding)

* **Compiled languages** (like C, C++) convert code into machine-level instructions before execution
* **Interpreted languages** (like Python) execute code during runtime

This makes Python easier to debug and experiment with, though generally slower than compiled languages.

## Important takeaway

Python prioritizes **clarity and developer productivity**.

The language is designed so that reading code is almost as important as writing it.
