# Python

This repository contains my personal Python notes and examples.

I am using this space to document Python in a simple and clear way, exactly how I understand it. The intention is to keep everything written down so I can come back anytime — months or years later — and quickly refresh my knowledge.

This is not meant to be fancy, fast, or exhaustive. It is meant to be useful, honest, and long-term.
